* The database schema must follow this schema:

## Bonus Requirements

* Update employee managers. ✔️
* View employees by manager. ✔️
* View employees by department. ✔️
* Delete:
    * departments
    * roles
    * employees ✔️
* View the total utilized budget of a department—in other words, the combined salaries of all employees in that department.

---

<a id="extraFunctionality"></a>
## Extra Functionality

* View all employees by role. ✔️
* View Employee Detail.✔️
    * I wanted this one so I could look at the changes the 'user' (me, as tester) made without having to show all employees and then manually looking through the whole table for the modified employee. After I added this, I added the functionality listed below this one, which made this unnecessary to its original purpose, but I left it anyway.
* After updating an employee (manager or role), display the employee details. ✔️
